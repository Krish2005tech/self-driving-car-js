# Self Driving Cars Simulation 🚗

A JavaScript-based self-driving car simulation that demonstrates neural networks and machine learning concepts in action.

## Disclaimer
This project is based on the excellent course by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor. The implementation follows his teaching methodology while incorporating personal modifications and improvements.

## Features
- 🤖 Neural network implementation for car decision making
- 🎮 Interactive controls for manual and autonomous driving
- 🚦 Traffic simulation with multiple autonomous vehicles
- 🛣️ Custom road generation and editing
- 📡 Sensor system for obstacle detection
- 💾 Save/Load functionality for trained models
- 🎨 Real-time visualization of neural network decisions
